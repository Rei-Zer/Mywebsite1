            <ol type="i">
                <li>Pacific Rim is a show where monsters from another planet invade earth. Humans then build huge robots
                     called Jaegers and since it is so huge it utilises DARPA tech to connect the minds of two humans creating a  Drift. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>A jaeger is so big that it requires 2 pilots to pilot it. Right hemesphiere and left hemesphiere.
                     Only some people can pilot with someone else.
                      That is called being drift compatible. The better the bond, the better you fight.</li>
                      <br>
                <li>There are a few jaegers left as the jaeger association nearly shut them down in the first movie. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Since these jaegers are so big, they need 8 jumphawks to carry them.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Each jaeger is assigned to a pair of pilots and the pilots are allowed to make modifications
                    as if their jaeger is built how they like it,they will fight better. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Jaegers are classified by the year they were made like mark 1, 2 and so on.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Jaegers were produced as they can fight kaiju's without using 
                    nuclear missiles so they are equipped with machine guns or swords. Even plasma weapons.</li>
