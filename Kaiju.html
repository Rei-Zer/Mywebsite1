            <ol type="i">
                <p>Kaiju are huge monsters from another world which is made by colonists called precursers.
                These Kaiju mission is to get to mount fuji and release toxic gas and terrafrm the Earth fro the Precursers.
                Kaiju enter our world through something called a breach.These pictures below are Kaiju from Uprising and not from the first movie.

                    <h3>Hakuja</h3>
                    <p> A catagory 4 Kaiju that can burrow underground.
                     It also has a spiked tail which can pierce through the armor of a Jaeger easily. Strikethorn even managed to
                     throw Bracer Phoenix through buildings.

                    <h3>Raijin</h3>
                    <p> A catagory 5 Kaiju which armor can absorb kinetic energy from jaegers and use it against them. Gypsy Avenger threw a
                    very powerful punch at Raijin and it quickly closed its head shell, absorbing the kinetic energy coming from the punch
                    and using it to power its own punch directed at Gypsy. </p>

                    <p> A catagory 4 kaiju which can shoot toxic spines.StrikeThorn pinned down Saber Athena with its spines while
                        Guardian Bravo came to assist and used the ark whip to smash Strike thorn through several buildings.

                    <h3>Dorone-Jaeger-Kaiju Hybrid.</h3>
                    <p> These things were Drone-Jaegers but were infected by Kaiju secondary brains creating these hybrids. These hybrids 
                    created an artificial breach which allowed Raijin, Hakuja and Strikethorn to enter Earth. There were over 50 of these 
                    Drone-Jaeger-Kaiju hybrids and they managed to destroy Titan Redeemer, Valor Omega, November Ajax and severely damage 
                    Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo, Bracer Phonix and Gypsy Avenger </p>

                    <h3>The Mega-Kaiju</h3>
                    <p> Hakuja, Strikethorn and Raijin merged due to robots made by the infected doctor newton
                    and posses all the abilities of each Kaiju as well as improving them. This managed to destroy Saber Athena,
                    Guardian Bravo, Bracer Phoenix and Gypsy Avenger simultaneously.</p> <p>All Jaegers fired and the mega-kaiju absorbed its attacks and punched the ground,
                    making all the Jaegers fly up in the air. All Jaegers had a rough landing accept
                    Guardian who landed on his feet. He then proceeded to attack the mega-kaiju against orders. He smacked the mega- kaiju
                    with his ark whip but the mega-kaiju caught it and smashed him into 7 nearby buildings,
                    killing one pilot and leaving the other pinned in the con-pod. It smashed Saber Athena's legs off with 
                    just its tails, and threw it into buildings. After that, Bracer Phoenix managed to knock one 
                    of its horns off before ats con-pod was crushed causing all pilots in it
                    to eject. While the mega-kaiju made its way up mount fuji, Gypsy Avenger welded itself to a rocket booster
                    with the help of Scrapper.Gypsy flew up into the air and Scrapper melted a hole in Gypsy's con-pop so the pilots could escape,
                    while the pilots used the Plasma cannon to righten itself. After escaping, Gypsy was dropped on top of the Kaiju. Destroying
                    them both. In the middle of the fight, Gypsy had to switch pilots as one of them was injured due to the mega-kaiju
                    smashing its tail through the con-pod. Luckily, Amara and Jake were drift compatible.</p>
